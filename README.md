# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK
The task involves designing a 4-stage pipelined processor in Verilog that can perform basic instructions such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD. The design demonstrates instruction execution through the following stages of a pipeline:

Pipeline Stages
Instruction Fetch (IF):

Fetches the instruction from the instruction memory.
Updates the program counter (PC) to fetch the next instruction.
Instruction Decode (ID):

Decodes the fetched instruction to identify the operation (opcode) and operands (registers or immediate values).
Reads source operands from the register file.
Execute (EX):

Performs arithmetic and logical operations using the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).
For LOAD instructions, calculates the effective memory address.
Memory Access (MEM):

Accesses the data memory for LOAD/STORE instructions.
Passes the results of arithmetic instructions for the next stage.
Write Back (WB):

Writes the results back to the destination register for arithmetic or LOAD instructions.
Key Components
Program Counter (PC):

Holds the address of the current instruction.
Updates to point to the next instruction after each clock cycle.
Instruction Memory:

Stores the instructions for execution.
Register File:

A set of registers for storing operands and results.
Two read ports and one write port for efficient operation.
ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):

Performs arithmetic (ADD, SUB) and logical operations.
Data Memory:

Used for LOAD/STORE instructions.
Pipeline Registers:

Separates the stages of the pipeline to hold intermediate data and control signals.
